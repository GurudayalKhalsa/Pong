Pong 
==================

A classic pong implementation with python and pygame

**Building**: 

    Install python and pygame, and run "python game.py" in terminal (make sure to be in same directory as folder), or other method of launching python apps
    Note - I have included a zipped mac app compiled by py2app if you do not want to compile
